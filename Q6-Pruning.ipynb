    "Pruning is a technique that cuts off parameters/structures from a model to increase sparcity and decrease overall model size, similar to cutting leafs or branches from bushes and trees. This process can lead to smaller memory consumption with minimal accuracy reduction. Moreover, pruning the network may also provide a speedup since there will be less operations being performed.\n",

For dropout, we temporary drop the neurons during training the help with generalization; but prune is permanent dropping from the model. Thus, dropout would be perfect for regularization, but pruning will definitely hurt accuracy as it lose capacity in exchange for faster performance during inference."
